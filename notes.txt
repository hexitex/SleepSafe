change env variables
----------------------------
From your directory in the command line run c9 ~/.bashrc

At the end of the .bashrc file that opens, add export API_KEY="your_api_key_here" to the end.
Save the file.

From the command line, run source ~/.bashrc to load the changes.
Then restart your console and/or server

To test if it worked, from your reloaded console, run ENV["API_KEY"] and it should output “your_api_key_here” or whatever value you put.

And repeat 1-3 with the ~/.profile file to get it to work in the command line server.
